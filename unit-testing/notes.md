# Notes

## Unit Testing - Khorikov

Vocabulary:
- out-of-process dependency: a dependency runling outside the control of the app under test e.g. a read only API or a dabase
- overspecification: Verifying things which are not part of the end result, leading to brittle test 
with a high potential for false positives.
